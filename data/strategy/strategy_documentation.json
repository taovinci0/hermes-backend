        "step_1": "We take all 24 hourly temperature forecasts from Zeus and find the maximum - this becomes our expected daily high temperature (μ).",
        "step_2": "We calculate how much the hourly temperatures vary (standard deviation) and multiply by √2 to account for the fact that daily highs have more uncertainty than individual hourly readings.",
        "step_3": "We use a normal distribution (bell curve) centered at our expected high, with the calculated uncertainty, to estimate the probability that the actual daily high falls into each temperature bracket.",
        "step_4": "The probabilities are normalized so they add up to 100% across all brackets."

      "how_it_works": {
        "step_1": "We take the peak temperature from Zeus forecasts as our expected daily high (μ).",
        "step_2": "If Zeus provides confidence bands (likely ≈80% and possible ≈95% ranges), we use these to calculate uncertainty (σ). We solve: σ = (upper_bound - mean) / z_score, where z_score is based on the confidence level.",
        "step_3": "We average the uncertainty estimates from both confidence levels to get a final σ value.",
